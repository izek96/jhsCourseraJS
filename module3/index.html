      Wang Kuang looked back and said, "Who is daring enough to go out and fight?" An officer in back of him galloped out on his horse, his spear in hand. Kuang saw that it was his famed officer from Henei Commandery, Fang Yue. The two squared off against each other; after not more than five bouts, he was stabbed by Lü Bu's trident halberd. Lü Bu then raised his halberd, and charged straight at them. Kuang's army was soundly defeated, and scattered in all four directions. Bu rode back and forth, killing everyone in his path, as if they were not even there. Fortunately, both the armies of Qiao Mao and Yuan Yi had arrived, and came to Wang Kuang's rescue. It was only then that Lü Bu retreated. The three of them had lost a number of horses and men, so they retreated for 30 li, and made camp. Later, the other five armies arrived, and they all got together to discuss the matter; they were saying things like Lü Bu was a hero, and that nobody could stand against him.
      <br><br>
      While they were considering the matter, a junior officer came to report that Lü Bu was calling them out to fight. The eight nobles all mounted their horses in unison. They split up into eight armies, while Bu watched them from a hilltop. Lü Bu took a group of cavalry, their embroidered flags fluttering in the wind, and charged ahead. Mu Shun, an officer under the command of Shangdang Commandery governor Zhang Yang, rode out on his horse, his spear in hand, to meet him in battle. He was knocked off of his horse from a single thrust of Lü Bu's halberd. Everyone was shocked. Wu Anguo, an officer under the command of Beihai Commandery governor Kong Rong, galloped out on his horse with his iron mallet in his hand. With a flourish of his halberd, Lü Bu smacked his horse on the rump, and rode out to intercept him. After more than ten bouts, a swipe of his halberd had cut off Anguo's hand at the wrist. He threw his mallet on the ground, and rode off. As soon as the soldiers from all eight armies had come out in unison to rescue Wu Anguo, Lü Bu retreated. All of the nobles returned to camp to discuss the matter. Cao Cao said, "Lü Bu is brave and has no equal in battle; we should gather the eighteen nobles to come up with a good strategy. If we were to capture Lü Bu, Dong Zhuo would be easy to kill."
      <br><br>
      While they were discussing the matter, Lü Bu again led his troops out to challenge the nobles to battle. The eight nobles all went out in unison. Gongsun Zan, wielding his long lance, personally fought with Lü Bu. After not more than a few rounds, Zan was defeated and fled. Lü Bu made Red Hare catch up with him. His horse was capable of traveling great distances in a single day, and was as fast as the wind. When he saw that he was about to catch up, Bu raised his trident halberd and stabbed straight at the center of Zan's back. An officer on the sidelines, who had big round eyes and whiskers that stood up on end, held up his 1.8 zhang snake lance and yelled out while galloping at full speed, "Don't run off, you house servant with three surnames! I, Zhang Fei from Yan, am here!"
      <br><br>
      When Lü Bu saw this, he abandoned his pursuit of Gongsun Zan, and took on Zhang Fei instead. Fei fought valiantly in a pitched battle against Lü Bu. They fought for more than fifty consecutive bouts, with no clear winner or loser. When Yunchang saw this, he slapped his horse on the rump, gave a flourish with his 82 catty Green Dragon Crescent Blade, and attacked Lü Bu from the other side so that Lü Bu was trapped between them. The three horses had now formed a "T" shape as they fought. After fighting for thirty bouts, they were unable to bring down Lü Bu. Then Liu Xuande drew both of the straight swords that he was wearing on his hips, and raced out on his yellow-maned horse from the side so that he could also assist in the fighting.
      <br><br>
      By the time of Huan and Ling, the sun had begun to set on the Han Dynasty. The evil minister Dong Zhuo deposed the young emperor, and his successor Liu Xie was weak and frightened by his own dreams. Cao Cao distributed an official call to arms throughout the land, and all of the nobles became angry and raised armies. After discussing the matter, they agreed to make Yuan Shao the leader of their alliance, and promised to bring stability and peace to the royal household. Marquis of Wen Lü Bu had no equal among men; the brave and talented came from all over, and bragged about their abilities. Lü Bu wore body armor which gleamed like silver, and was wavy like the scales of a dragon; he fastened his hair underneath a golden headpiece with hairpins that had pheasant tails attached to them. His uneven belt had a clasp that depicted a beast swallowing a whole head, and his shabby robe was brocaded with flying phoenix birds. His dragon steed could sprint like the wind, and his painted halberd glistened like the clear waters of autumn. When he emerged from the pass to challenge the enemy, who would dare to stand against him? The nobles were all scared out of their minds. From among them, emerged a man from Yan named Zhang Yide, who carried his 1.8 zhang snake lance. His tiger-like whiskers stood up at the ends like golden wire, and when he opened his big round eyes, they were penetrating like a bolt of lightning. Zhang Fei and Lü Bu fought desperately without a clear winner or loser; then Guan Yunchang became angry while watching the battle. His Green Dragon Blade gleamed like frost and snow, and his battle garment, embroidered with parrots, fluttered like a butterfly. The hooves of his horse thundered all about like demons and spirits howling; once he became angry, blood often flowed from whatever stood before him. The hero Xuande held his two straight swords, and conjured his majestic powers, displaying courage and ferocity. The three of them surrounded Lü Bu for a long time, and they fought continuously without a break. The sounds of war cries shook the earth, as the air of murder blanketed the cold skies between the Ox and Dipper constellations. Lü Bu's energy was depleted, and he was looking for an escape route; he saw his mountain stronghold in the distance; he slapped his horse on the rump so that he could return there. He dragged the painted pole of his square sky halberd; his army was left in tatters, leaving behind melted down metal weapons and multi-colored banners. He escaped on Red Hare, yanking on his reigns which were made of silk chords; turning around, he sprinted to the top of Hulao Pass.
